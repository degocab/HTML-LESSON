        <b>This is bold text.</b>
            <div>
            <p>
                The strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold tag but the strong tag also marks the enclosed text as more important. It is also easier for the screen readers for the visually disabled.

        <div>
            <i>This text is italics</i>
            <p>
                The emphasis tag has the same visual effect as the italic tag but the emphasis tag also marks the enclosed text as more important.
            </p>
        </div>
        <em>This is wht emphasized text looks like.</em>
                <h2><b>Subscript and Superscript</b></h2>

        <p>
            Blockquoted text looks like this
